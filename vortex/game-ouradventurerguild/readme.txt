# Against The Storm Vortex Extension  

## Overview  
This is an extension for supporting *Against The Storm* in Vortex.  

This is my first time creating a mod for Vortex, so I apologize if anything is incorrect.  

The source code is available on GitHub.  
If you encounter any issues, please feel free to report them via GitHub issues or Twitter.

## Installation  

### Requirements  
This extension depends on the following version of BepInEx.  
When you install this extension, BepInEx will be automatically installed into the *Against The Storm* folder.  

ðŸ”— [BepInEx v5.4.23.2](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2)  

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)  
1. Download and install **Vortex** from Nexus Mods.  
2. Install this extension through Vortex.  
3. Vortex will automatically set up BepInEx and place mods in the correct directory.  

### Manual Installation  
If you prefer manual installation, follow these steps:  
1. Download and extract the mod files.  
2. Copy the extracted files to the following directory:  
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Against the Storm\BepInEx
*(The path may vary depending on your installation folder.)*  

## How It Works  
- When you install this extension, it will automatically install BepInEx into the *Against The Storm* directory.  
- Mods will be copied automatically to the BepInEx `plugins` folder.  

## Troubleshooting  
If you experience any issues, please:  
- Check that **BepInEx is installed correctly** in the game folder.  
- Verify that **mods are placed inside the `plugins` folder`** (`BepInEx/plugins`).  
- Restart Vortex and ensure the mod is enabled.
